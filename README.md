Google-Earth-KML-Generator
==========================

An Excel To Google Earth KML Generator. A very handy tool for Humanitarian workers. Requires windows / .net Framework 4.5
Working as an Information Management Officer in one of the biggest humanitarian operations in the world 
I needed a tool with which I can quickly convert excel data tables to Google Earth. 
This tool has to following features: 

- Geocodes text address into coordinates
- Adds Altitude to GPS coordinate points
- Generates KML files in which you can customize:
  *Icons
  *Labels
  *Popup description

Tool was developed in a rush - sorry for the messy code, will try to fix it as soon as possible. Tool still does the job.
